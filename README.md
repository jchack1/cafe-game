### Cafe game

Made with react, typescript and vite.

You just make drinks. It's in the initial stages. All that's here is the game logic. Later there will be graphics with drag and drop functionality.

TO-DOs:

- style game area, refactor as I add more components
- create nicer images for ingredients and mug
- have multiple orders going at once
  - keep state for multiple mugs
  - handle dragging into mugs with different ids
- handle fail scenario - do we get rid of the ingredients? get a new order or let player try again?

Future TO-DOs:

- points system
- how to handle increasing difficulty and levels?
- different types of drinks? more ingredients
- music/sound effects
