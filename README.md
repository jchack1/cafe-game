### Cafe game

Made with react, typescript and vite.

You just make drinks. It's in the initial stages. All that's here is the game logic. Later there will be graphics with drag and drop functionality.

TO-DOs:

- style game area, refactor as I add more components
  - make styled components instead of having so many divs with inline flexbox styling
- create nicer images for ingredients and mug
- nicer recipe area that includes all recipes - button to toggle through them all
- handle fail scenario - do we get rid of the ingredients? get a new order or let player try again?
  - throw away the ingredients - need a "clear" button of some kind

Future TO-DOs:

- points system
  - how to calculate and save
  - do we need a backend or is localStorage enough?
- how to handle increasing difficulty and levels?
- more drinks in one order as difficulty increases
- different types of drinks? more ingredients
- music/sound effects
