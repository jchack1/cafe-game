### Cafe game

Made with react, typescript and vite.

You just make drinks. It's in the initial stages, mostly just logic without pretty styling. Drag and drop ingredients into a cup.

TO-DOs:

- style game area, refactor as I add more components
  - make styled components instead of having so many divs with inline flexbox styling
- create nicer images for ingredients and mug
- nicer recipe area that includes all recipes - button to toggle through them all
- handle fail scenario - do we get rid of the ingredients? get a new order or let player try again?
  - throw away the ingredients - need a "clear" button of some kind

Future TO-DOs:

- points system
  - how to calculate and save
  - do we need a backend or is localStorage enough?
- how to handle increasing difficulty and levels?
- more drinks in one order as difficulty increases
- different types of drinks? more ingredients
- music/sound effects
